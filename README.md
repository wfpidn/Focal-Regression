# Focal (linear) regression between every 5x5 pixels group of cells of two rasters

As part of Extreme Rainfall model development activities (When the rainfall trigger a flood?), and based on two rasters with same resolution and dimension, we would like to create a new raster of ```SLOPE (a)``` and ```INTERCEPT (b)``` by performing linear regression between every ```5×5``` pixels of the two rasters, such that each pixel of the ```SLOPE``` and ```INTERCEPT``` will hold the regression ```slope``` and ```intercept``` value obtained from linear regression of the corresponding ```5×5``` pixels that surround that pixel.

## Application
The result will be use as input to generate flood probability when the daily rainfall forecast is available. 

## Data
Indonesia data are provided for example analysis, both data came from below.
- Daily rainfall estimate.
39 years (1981-2019) daily rainfall data used in the analysis are downloaded from Climate Hazards Center - UC Santa Barbara (https://chc.ucsb.edu/data-sets/chirps), and 
- Monthly Water History. 
This Monthly History collection holds the entire history of water detection on a month-by-month basis. The collection contains 430 images, one for each month between March 1984 and December 2019. Each pixel was individually classified into water / non-water using an expert system and the results were collated into a monthly history for the entire time period and two epochs (1984-1999, 2000-2019) for change detection. Downloaded from Google Earth Engine: https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/JRC_GSW1_2_MonthlyHistory

```WDay1_03.tif``` is the maximum 1-day rainfall value in March for the period 1981 - 2019, and

```gi03.tif``` is result from ```ln(x/(1-x))```, where x is the percentage of historical flood (pixel with water) occurrence in March for the period 1984-2019, calculate based on Monthly Water History data.
